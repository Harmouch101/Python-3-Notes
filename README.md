## Simple Summary

A collection of notes, speaker's slides deck, files related to pycon talks, and a list of handful python books I read and/or am currently reading. This repository can be used as a reference/documentation for mastering the python programming language and the Django framework.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è This repo is currently under construction. Consider giving a ‚≠ê for future updates!    

> If you are looking for a way to contribute to the project, please refer to the [`Guideline`][00].  

> Currently maintained by [`Mahmoud Harmouch`][01].  

## üí™ Motivation

In the last couple of years, many of us have gone through challenging moments in many different ways, both physically and mentally. And in time of need, `Pycon` was already there playing the role of a spiritual leader, helping us make the time pass by faster, easier with joy. Consequently, we need to come together to form a small community within a hobby that would add value for our and subsequent generations and make it easier to learn python related content by sharing notes.

In my honest opinion, information must be free of charge and easily accessible for all kinds of people around the globe. Given the fact that the `Pycon` content is already out there for free, I realized that it is a bit harder to locate the slides associated with a given video. Hence, we should have a centralized place where you can easily access the slide decks without a hustle, going after many google searches. 

This repository serves three primary roles:

1. Sharing my own notes of what I learned while watching the conference on YT.

2. Creating backup storage for each speaker's files and slide decks.

3. Sharing a handful list of books that can play a significant role in honing your python skills. 

## üìú Requirements:

The python ecosystem is awash with books for beginners but few books target readers that are past the beginning stages but are not yet advanced users. The book aims to bridge that gap.

The content of this book looks primarily at the various means for code organization in Python and provides user with a rigorous grounding in these. it dives into topics such as python object system, functions, decorators, metaprogramming and generators providing the reader with an in-depth knowledge of these topics that is essential for writing idiomatic and robust python code. It aims to  provide a reader with not only a how-to but also a why for Python concepts. Concepts are well explained with abundance of code snippets.

If you are looking for a book to take you beyond the beginner level in python, this is definitely the right book for you.

Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a popular design paradigm in which data and behaviors are encapsulated in such a way that they can be manipulated together. This third edition of Python 3 Object-Oriented Programming fully explains classes, data encapsulation, and exceptions with an emphasis on when you can use each principle to develop well-designed software.

Starting with a detailed analysis of object-oriented programming, you will use the Python programming language to clearly grasp key concepts from the object-oriented paradigm. You will learn how to create maintainable applications by studying higher level design patterns. The book will show you the complexities of string and file manipulation, and how Python distinguishes between binary and textual data. Not one, but two very powerful automated testing systems, unittest and pytest, will be introduced in this book. You'll get a comprehensive introduction to Python's concurrent programming ecosystem.

THIS TEXTBOOK is about computer science. It is also about Python. However, there is much more. The study of algorithms and data structures is central to understanding what computer science is all about. Learning computer science is not unlike learning any other type of difficult subject matter. The only way to be successful is through deliberate and incremental exposure to the fundamental ideas. A beginning computer scientist needs practice so that there is a thorough understanding before continuing on to the more complex parts of the curriculum. In addition, a beginner needs to be given the opportunity to be successful and gain confidence. This textbook is designed to serve as a text for a first course on data structures and algorithms, typically taught as the second course in the computer science curriculum. Even though the second course is considered more advanced than the first course, this book assumes you are beginners at this level. You may still be struggling with some of the basic ideas and skills from a first computer science course and yet be ready to further explore the discipline and continue to practice problem solving. We cover abstract data types and data structures, writing algorithms, and solving problems. We look at a number of data structures and solve classic problems that arise. The tools and techniques that you learn here will be applied over and over as you continue your study of computer science.

### Fluent Python <a name="books3.3.1"></a>  

by Luciano Ramalho, 1st Edition.\[[Amazon\]](https://www.amazon.com/_/dp/1491946008?tag=oreilly20-20) \[[Publisher\]](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/fluent-python/9781491946237/)

Python‚Äôs simplicity lets you become productive quickly, but this often means you aren‚Äôt using everything it has to offer. With this hands-on guide, you‚Äôll learn how to write effective, idiomatic Python code by leveraging its best‚Äîand possibly most neglected‚Äîfeatures. Author Luciano Ramalho takes you through Python‚Äôs core language features and libraries, and shows you how to make your code shorter, faster, and more readable at the same time.

Many experienced programmers try to bend Python to fit patterns they learned from other languages, and never discover Python features outside of their experience. With this book, those Python programmers will thoroughly learn how to become proficient in Python 3.

### Mastering Python High Performance <a name="books3.3.2"></a> </a>

by Fernando Doglio, 1st Edition.\[[Amazon\]](https://www.amazon.com/Mastering-Python-Performance-Fernando-Doglio/dp/1783989300) \[[Publisher\]](https://www.packtpub.com/product/mastering-python-high-performance/9781783989300)

This book starts from the basics and progressively moves on to more advanced topics. You‚Äôll learn everything from profiling all the way up to writing a real-life application and applying a full set of tools designed to improve it in different ways. In the middle, you‚Äôll stop to learn about the major profilers used in Python and about some graphic tools to help you make sense of their output. You‚Äôll then move from generic optimization techniques onto Python-specific ones, going over the main constructs of the language that will help you improve your speed without much of a change. Finally, the book covers some number-crunching-specific libraries and how to use them properly to get the best speed out of them.

### Python Testing with pytest <a name="books3.3.3"></a> 

by Brian Okken, 1st Edition. \[[Amazon\]](https://www.amazon.com/Python-Testing-pytest-Effective-Scalable/dp/1680502409) \[[Publisher\]](https://pragprog.com/titles/bopytest/python-testing-with-pytest/)

With simple step-by-step instructions and sample code, this book gets you up to speed quickly on this easy-to-learn and robust tool. Write short, maintainable tests that elegantly express what you‚Äôre testing. Add powerful testing features and still speed up test times by distributing tests across multiple processors and running tests in parallel. Use the built-in assert statements to reduce false test failures by separating setup and test failures. Test error conditions and corner cases with expected exception testing, and use one test to run many test cases with parameterized testing. Extend pytest with plugins, connect it to continuous integration systems, and use it in tandem with tox, mock, coverage, unittest, and doctest.
